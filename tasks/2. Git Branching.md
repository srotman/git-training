Branches
--------
- Create 2 branches (first, second)

- Checkout the first branch and find the "Lorem Ipsum.txt" file in the lorem folder.
- Change it and commit it.

- Checkout the second branch.
- Add a new file in the lorem folder and fill it with random content.

- Merge the first branch into the "branches" branch using a non-fast-forward merge
- Delete the first branch

- Rebase the second branch on the "branches" branch
- Merge the second branch in the "branches" branch using a fast-forward merge

- Merge the "branches" branch in the "master" branch

- Merge the "conflict" branch in the "master" branch

- Undo the merge (reset) and merge again trying out different merging strategies
